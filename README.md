# Address book in Java (Coursework) 

### A simple address book application written in Java as coursework for JAV41 at AKAD University.

Hello to whoever might be reading this!

This repository contains a small school project that I had to do for University. 
Therefore it is mainly for myself as version control while I am taking this project past the requirements set by the course. It was made public so the code can be shared with classmates who might be interested in seing someone elses implementation of the previously mentioned requirements.


*Just to avoid any confusion;  Class-, Variable- and Method declarations will be German as I am attending a German university. Nameing conventions in Java were still followed resulting in a mix of German and English as for example ```getVorname()```.* 

#### Future improvements

This will be quick overview of future improvements that I have planned. These are purely for my own interest.

- [ ] Implementing a hash map for the ``` getFreund()``` method to improve on the current search time of (O)N. 
- [ ] Using JDBC to connect the address book to an SQL database to make changes, additions etc. permanent on disk rather than temporary in memory. (The addition will be found in the *JDBC* branch of this repo.)
- [ ] Refactoring the code and add comments for better understanding (famous last words lol).
